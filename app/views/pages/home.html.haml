        Welcome to my site,
    %p
      This site was started as place to send prospective employers, but now that I am happily employed, it is a repository to collect my ramblings and side projects.
    %p
      Here are a few projects I have going:
      %ul
        %li
          %a= link_to "Font Lab", "/users/sign_in"
        %li
          %a= link_to "CSS Splitter", "#"
  = render partial: "sidenav"
