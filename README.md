# Patrick Holloway's Resume App

This is a place for me to put some basic code and relevant recruiting information on display for prospective employers. The bulk of my experience so far has been on a web application that is still in active development and isn't mine to show off to the world. While I am job hunting I still need *something* to show CTOs, hiring managers, and recruiters.

The code is very simple, as I only have a few hours to build it, but you can see that I am comfortable with Ruby on Rails and associated technologies.

In this project I incorporate the following:

-	Ruby on Rails
-	Twitter Bootstrap
-	SASS
-	HAML
-	javascript
-	jQuery
-	git/github
-	Heroku
- PostrgreSQL via Active Record
- various ruby gems

On a basic level, this demonstrates that I not only know the individual technologies, but how to incorporate them to make clean, reusable, and readable code.

I am not a seasoned developer, but an up and coming, self-taught guy eager to learn more.
