# Patrick Holloway's Resume App

This is a place for me to put some basic code and relevant recruiting information on display for prospective employers. The bulk of my experience so far has been on a web application that is still in active development and isn't mine to show off to the world. While I am job hunting I still need *something* to show CTOs, hiring managers, and recruiters.

The code is very simple, as I only have a few hours to build it, but you can see that I am comfortable with Ruby on Rails and associated technologies.

In this project I incorporate the following:

-	Ruby on Rails
-	Twitter Bootstrap
-	SASS
-	HAML
-	javascript
-	jQuery
-	git/github
-	Heroku
- PostrgreSQL via Active Record
- various ruby gems

On a basic level, this demonstrates that I not only know the individual technologies, but how to incorporate them to make clean, reusable, and readable code.

I am not a seasoned developer, but an up and coming, self-taught guy eager to learn more.

The "Demo" section of the site is the next on the plate, seeing as the rest of the site is essentially serving up static pages. I'm hoping to incorporate something that captures the power of rails, demonstrates some front-end skills with jQuery and AJAX, and ties in a restful web API.
